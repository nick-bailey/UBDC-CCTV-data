# UBDC-CCTV-data

This repository contains some examples of R code written to make use of data created by the Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC - https://www.ubdc.ac.uk) at University of Glasgow. UBDC uses object detection models on images from Glasgow City Council's CCTV system, producing hourly counts of the number of pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles for different locations across the city. The code downloads data via an API and shows how it can be processed to produce a range of urban indicators. 

### Update 2023
The API was updated in 2023 so older, redundant code has been placed in a separate folder.
